## Dataset Description

The "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset" contains sensor data from Samsung Galaxy S smartphones worn by volunteers. The data captures various activities such as walking, sitting, and standing.

## Variable Descriptions

The dataset consists of numerous variables capturing accelerometer and gyroscope measurements, along with derived features like mean, standard deviation, and magnitude.

## Transformation Procedures

The analysis involves several key steps:
1. Merging both training and test datasets.
2. Extracting pertinent features related to mean and standard deviation.
3. Assigning descriptive activity names.
4. Appropriately labeling variables for clarity.
5. Aggregating data to produce a tidy dataset for further analysis.
